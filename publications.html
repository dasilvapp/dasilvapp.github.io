            This article aims to discuss to what extent populist parties with
            opposite ideological backgrounds have differed in their policies
            towards inherited external financial liberalization (EFL). Building
            upon a comparative case study centred on Argentina under Kirchnerism
            (2003-15) and Hungary under Viktor Orbán (since 2010), I conclude
            that both experiences led to a partial EFL reversal. However,
            reflecting their opposite ideological underpinnings, each subtype of
            populism opted to restrict a different dimension of EFL. Argentina's
            left-wing populism re-regulated cross-border capital flows, harming
            financial operators, foreign investors and primary exporters through
            capital controls and export surrenders. These interventionist
            capital account regulations were needed to shield expansionary
            macroeconomic policies that attended the interests of subordinate
            socioeconomic strata, fuelling the tension with financial markets
            and domestic economic elites. Conversely, Hungary's right-wing
            populism focused on the ownership structure of the banking sector,
            aiming to redistribute assets from foreign to domestic private banks
            and improve the credit conditions for native capitalists. In this
            case, even when resorting to macroeconomic heterodoxy, the
            maintenance of fiscal balance and price stability retained support
            from both foreign investors and domestic business groups, mitigating
            tensions derived from financial nationalism.

            This article discusses why Latin American post-neoliberal parties
            have varied in their strategies of capital flow management. In
            brief, I propose that two complementary channels favor the pursuit
            of heterodox strategies: high degree of pressure from popular
            sectors that push for an immediate macroeconomic reorientation, and
            strategic allies among economic elites that mitigate the credibility
            losses associated with this decision. The comparative case-study on
            Argentina under Kirchnerism (2003-2015) and Brazil under the
            Workers’ Party (2003-2016) provides support for this argument. In
            the former case, the ruling party had to address the demands from
            strong and autonomous unions and social movements, while counting on
            a strategic alliance with domestic manufacturing producers. In the
            latter, conversely, the governing party lacked strategic allies
            among economic elites and could overlook the agenda of weak and
            subordinate popular organisations. In other words, both popular and
            elite channels favored the adoption of a heterodox strategy of
            capital flow management by Kirchnerism, while neither of them did in
            the case of the Workers’ Party. In Argentina, the option for
            heterodoxy also contributed to the repoliticisation of capital flow
            management by returning the visibility of this policy issue and
            impelling policymakers to go beyond technocratic discourses.

            Have Brazil’s capital flows management measures (CFMs) changed after
            the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)? This article explains Brazil’s
            CFMs after the GFC as part of a (failed) attempt to gradually move
            away from embedded neoliberalism. It proposes a Polanyian approach
            that captures both the change (emphasized by the policy space
            approach) and the continuity (underscored by the scalar-relational
            and financialization approaches) underlying Brazil’s CFMs after the
            GFC. It argues that the change stems from the conflict between
            different political economy coalitions, while the continuity is
            rooted in the shared acceptance of major objectives of
            neoliberalism—capital mobility and financial integration.

            This article assesses the impact of post-neoliberal governments on
            the level of capital controls in 17 Latin American countries for the
            period between 1995 and 2017. Contrary to administrations led by
            other left-of-center parties, especially the ones affiliated to the
            Socialist International, I contend that post-neoliberal parties,
            affiliated to the São Paulo Forum, opted to reregulate capital flows
            for three main reasons: increasing macroeconomic policy autonomy,
            favoring their constituencies, and/or giving concreteness to the
            rhetoric against financial and foreign interests. After proposing a
            new capital controls index and estimating a time-series
            cross-section model, I find that post-neoliberalism has been
            associated with an increase in the level of controls. Besides this
            main conclusion, I also find that larger financial sectors
            contribute to counteracting the reregulation of capital flows by
            post-neoliberal governments.

            Contrary to expectations, the global push for liberalizing reforms
            during the 1980s and 1990s did not abolish policy diversity in
            regard to capital flow management. Even though many countries fully
            opened their capital accounts, there remain several examples of
            divergence, which go from the maintenance of high levels of capital
            controls to partial liberalization. Against this background, relying
            on data from 84 countries between 1995 and 2017, this article uses
            fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to shed light on
            the conditions underlying different capital account regimes. In line
            with the Polanyian theoretical framework, findings reveal that two
            kinds of causal paths paved the way for intermediate regimes: the
            statist path was followed by right-leaning authoritarian regimes
            that attempted to combine the integration into global markets with
            the maintenance of control over the domestic private sector; the
            pluralist path was observed where either manufacturing industries or
            popular sectors were strong enough to motivate the reregulation of
            capital flows. Conversely, findings show that extreme regimes such
            as open and closed ones were associated with homogenous conditions
            like, respectively, leftist authoritarian regimes and rich
            democracies with stable economies.

            We explore how China's geographically targeted policies impact RMB
            overseas use individually or in combination. The policies include
            swap agreements, clearing banks, investment quotas, and direct
            trading between Chinese renminbi (RMB) and non-USD currencies.
            Adopting a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and using Bank
            of International Settlements cross-country data on foreign exchange
            markets, we find that institution building has lowered the barriers
            to international adoption of the RMB. Specifically, for countries
            economically close to China, high RMB trading is explained by either
            (i) having a clearing bank in the host market and direct quotations
            between the RMB and the local currency, or (ii) being a financial
            center and having access to the Chinese capital market. This
            combination of policies is explained by the creation of (i) “trading
            posts” that provide RMB liquidity abroad, and (ii) channels that
            allow actors to “recycle” offshore RMB funds. We triangulate our
            results with interviews conducted with senior People's Bank of China
            officials.

            This article relies on a Polanyian-inspired theoretical framework to
            compare political economy strategies adopted by Brazilian
            governments after democratisation. Responding to competing interests
            from the financial sector, the manufacturing industry, and the
            working class, these governments have chosen between disembedded
            neoliberal, embedded neoliberal and neocorporatist strategies,
            facing different challenges and crises. After the short-lived
            adoption of disembedded neoliberalism in the early 1990s, embedded
            neoliberal governments were able to conciliate economic
            liberalisation and orthodox macroeconomic policies with political
            stability and social cohesion, while compensating the manufacturing
            industry and the working class for some of their losses. In the late
            2000s, however, discontentment within these social groups with
            regard to insufficient economic growth opened the way for the
            emergence of neocorporatism, which eased the commitment to
            liberalisation and macroeconomic orthodoxy in order to expand
            industrial policies, social protection and labour market regulation.
            The crisis of neocorporatism, which culminated in the 2016
            impeachment, provided a new opportunity for disembedded
            neoliberalism, putting the interests of the financial sector at the
            centre of policy formulation.

            2016. Its main contributions are to assess the influence of the
            global financial cycle on the level of external financial
            liberalization and to analyse the short- and long-run macroeconomic
            effects of such liberalization on the performance of a peripheral
            economy in the global currency hierarchy. Methodologically, the
            article employs the Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive and
            Vector Error Correction models. The results show that the global
            financial cycle directly affects cross-border financial flows and
            frames the impact of external financial liberalization on the
            macroeconomic performance. The article concludes that external
            financial liberalization has negative macroeconomic effects in the
            short run and generates a trade-off between stability and growth in
            the long run.

            In light of the global financial cycle (GFC), this paper
            investigates the effectiveness of monetary policy in Brazil since
            the adoption of the inflation targeting regime. The theoretical
            section analyses monetary policy from the New Macroeconomic
            Consensus perspective, emphasizing the implications of the GFC. It
            also contrasts central bank theory with the post-Keynesian critique.
            For the empirical investigation, a Markov-switching vector
            autoregressive model is estimated from January 2000 to December
            2017, combining the common variables from the empirical literature
            with the proxy for the GFC. The main results suggest that greater
            financial instability has a direct effect on domestic inflation.

            Recent studies have discussed the influence of the global financial
            cycle on capital flows to emerging and developing countries. This
            paper evaluates the relationship between the greater degree of
            financial integration, and macroeconomic performance over the last
            two decades in Brazil. The literature has highlighted the Brazilian
            experience as being paradigmatic among emerging countries regarding
            the relationship between financial integration and regulation of
            capital flows to deal with boom and bust cycles. Methodologically,
            we employ a vector autoregressive model with error correction that
            allows us to evaluate the cointegration between the variables. Our
            main hypothesis is that a greater degree of financial integration is
            associated with negative developments in variables such as gross
            domestic product, country risk, interest rates, and exchange rate
            volatility. In addition, this study presents a further contribution
            by observing the existence of the interaction between the
            consequences of financial integration and the global financial
            cycle. More specifically, we found that: (i) an increase in the
            degree of financial integration generates deeper effects in downward
            periods of the global financial cycle; and (ii) a decline in that
            cycle generates greater impacts when a higher degree of financial
            integration is present.

            Responding to global events, including the international financial
            crisis (IFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks and the
            monetary regimes in many Latin American countries responded with
            actions to mitigate the worst impacts. The authors in this book
            focus on the recent trends of monetary policy in Latin America and
            analyze how the actions that were taken have affected the economic
            performance of these countries.

            In this book, we provide some contributions that show the most
            recent approaches showing to which extent economic policies would
            overcome a sustainable economic development. First, we will review
            the current situation and the perspectives of development theories
            and policies. Next, we will show the scope of both demand-side and
            supply-side policies, when trying to achieve economic development.
            Finally, we will show several examples of how developing countries
            from the Latin America area are dealing with the current situation
            after the economic crisis, in light of the Sustainable Development
            Goals.

            Since the late 1990s, conventional wisdom has been challenged by the
            increasing instability of the financial markets. In this context,
            the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), which began in August 2007, and
            the “Great Recession ” (GR) that followed, led the governments of
            advanced and emerging countries to adopt countercyclical fiscal and
            monetary policies, mainly monetary policies, in an attempt to rescue
            financial and non-financial corporations . Brazil was not an
            exception. This chapter analyzes the Brazilian credit market during
            the GR. More specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that
            State-owned Banks (SOB) are able to play a positive role in
            stabilizing aggregate credit, particularly during financial crises.
            Using two different econometric approaches, Markov-Switching Vector
            Autoregressive Models (MS-VAR) and Vector Error Correction (VEC)
            models, we will provide relevant evidence that would suggest that
            the credit originated in SOB shows countercyclical characteristics,
            while private banks behave in a typical pro-cyclical manner.
